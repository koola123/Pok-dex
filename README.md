# Pokédex

Pokédex is a web app built with `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `j.Query` and `Bootstrap`.
It loads data from an *external API* and enables the user to view data points as Pokémons from a JSON list.

The main purpose of this app is to present how I create a JavaScript app.<br>

This site was built using GitHub Pages.
